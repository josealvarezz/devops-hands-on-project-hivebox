# HiveBox - DevOps End-to-End Hands-On Project (Personal Fork)

> **Note:** This is my personal fork of the HiveBox project for learning and hands-on DevOps practice.  
> All development is done via Pull Requests on my forked repository. Do not submit PRs to the upstream/original repo.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   fastapi dev app/main.py
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
4. **Check the API:**
   - Open [http://localhost:8000/version](http://localhost:8000/version) in your browser.
   - You should see:
     ```json
     { "version": "0.2.0" }
     ```
   - The `/temperature` endpoint returns the average temperature of the 3 selected senseBoxes, if data is less than 1 hour old, and includes a `status` field.
   - The `/metrics` endpoint returns Prometheus metrics about the app.

## Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t hivebox:0.2.0 .
   ```
2. **Run the container (with custom senseBox IDs):**

   ```sh
   docker run --rm -p 8000:80 -e SENSEBOX_IDS="id1,id2,id3" hivebox:0.2.0
   ```

   If you omit `SENSEBOX_IDS`, the default IDs will be used.

3. **Test the API:**
   - Open [http://localhost:8000/version](http://localhost:8000/version)  
     **You should see:**
     ```json
     { "version": "0.2.0" }
     ```
   - Open [http://localhost:8000/temperature](http://localhost:8000/temperature)  
     **You should see (example):**
     ```json
     {
       "temperature": 21.67,
       "status": "Good"
     }
     ```
   - Open [http://localhost:8000/metrics](http://localhost:8000/metrics)

## Kubernetes Deployment

The project includes manifests to deploy HiveBox on a Kubernetes cluster. The files are located in the `k8s/` directory and include:

- `hivebox-deployment.yaml`: Deployment for the HiveBox application.
- `hivebox-service.yaml`: ClusterIP Service to expose the application internally within the cluster.
- `hivebox-ingress.yaml`: Ingress to route HTTP traffic to the HiveBox service using the NGINX Ingress Controller.
- `deploy-ingress-nginx.yaml`: Full manifest to deploy the NGINX Ingress Controller in the cluster.
- `kind-cluster.yaml`: Configuration to create a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind, with port mappings for HTTP (8080) and HTTPS (8443).

These manifests allow you to easily deploy and expose the application in a local or cloud-based Kubernetes environment.

### How to use the Kubernetes manifests

1. **Create a local Kind cluster:**
   ```sh
   kind create cluster --config k8s/kind-cluster.yaml
   ```
2. **Deploy the NGINX Ingress Controller:**
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deploy-ingress-nginx.yaml
   ```
3. **Build and load the Docker image into Kind:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t hivebox:0.2.0 .
   kind load docker-image hivebox:0.2.0
   ```
4. **Deploy HiveBox resources:**
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f k8s/hivebox-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/hivebox-service.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/hivebox-ingress.yaml
   ```
5. **Access the API:**
   - Open [http://localhost:8080/version](http://localhost:8080/version) in your browser.
   - The `/temperature` and `/metrics` endpoints are also available at this address.

**Note:**

- You can customize the senseBox IDs by editing the `SENSEBOX_IDS` environment variable in the deployment manifest (`hivebox-deployment.yaml`).
- If you are using a cloud Kubernetes provider, you may need to adapt the manifests (e.g., change the Service type to `LoadBalancer`).

## Continuous Integration

- **ci.yml**: Runs on all pull requests to `main` only.

  - Ensures that all code merged into `main` passes linting, testing, and Docker build checks before being accepted.
  - The workflow covers:
    - Python linting (`pylint`)
    - Dockerfile linting (`hadolint`)
    - Unit and integration testing (`pytest`)
    - Docker image build (verifies Dockerfile and packaging)

- **scorecards-analysis.yml**: Runs only on push to `main`.
  - Performs OpenSSF Scorecard security checks on the latest state of the main branch.
  - Keeps the security badge and repository analysis up to date.

## Testing

1. **Run all tests:**
   ```sh
   pytest
   ```
2. **What is tested:**
   - `/version` endpoint (returns version, always works)
   - `/temperature` endpoint:
     - Happy path (recent data, correct average, correct status)
     - No recent data (returns 404)
     - Some boxes with/without valid data (partial average)
     - Data corrupt or incomplete (ignores those boxes)
     - External API failure (returns 502)
     - Extreme temperature values (calculates average and status)
     - Non-existent senseBox IDs (treated as no data)
   - **Integration test**: Real call to `/temperature` endpoint (may depend on external API availability)

## Endpoints

| Endpoint       | Method | Description                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/version`     | GET    | Returns current app version                                                  |
| `/temperature` | GET    | Returns current average temperature from 3 senseBoxes, with a `status` field |
| `/metrics`     | GET    | Returns default Prometheus metrics about the app                             |

## Implementation

### MVP Scope

HiveBox builds an API to track environmental data from various sensors using openSenseMap.  
The minimal viable product is an API that returns the same data visible on a given sensor's web pageâ€”no logs or historical tracking included.

### Technology Stack Decision

Although most of my previous API experience has been with Java Spring Boot, I have decided to use **FastAPI** for this project.

- The HiveBox documentation recommends Flask or FastAPI.
- I want to broaden my backend skills and try a modern Python-based framework to compare it with my Spring Boot experience.

### Contribution & Branch Strategy

- All main changes are submitted as Pull Requests for each project phase.
- No direct pushes to the `main` branch are allowed.
- **ci.yml** runs on pull requests to `main` (for linting, testing, and build).
- **scorecards-analysis.yml** runs on push to `main` (for security checks).

### senseBox Sensors

These are the three senseBox sensors selected from [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org):

- [2729902 Bachstraat](https://opensensemap.org/explore/5c72ec079e6756001987288b)
- [Hesse](https://opensensemap.org/explore/61eec6bf848248001ba4beeb)
- [Aureliahof Utrecht](https://opensensemap.org/explore/61bf38bf19a991001b0e5cb4)
